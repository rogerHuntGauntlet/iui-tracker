# Security Policy

## Our Privacy-First Approach

IUI Success Tracker is designed with a strict privacy-first approach:

1. **No Data Storage**
   - The application does not store any user data
   - No local storage
   - No cookies
   - No server-side storage

2. **No User Tracking**
   - No analytics
   - No user accounts
   - No session tracking
   - No usage metrics

3. **Client-Side Only**
   - All calculations happen in your browser

   - No API calls
   - No external services
