* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### TypeScript Styleguide

* Follow the [TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)
* Use types instead of interfaces for consistency
* Avoid using `any` - use proper typing
* Use type inference when possible
* Export types and interfaces when they're needed in other files
* Do not introduce any data persistence or storage mechanisms

### React Styleguide

* Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
* Keep components small and focused (< 300 lines)
* Use React.memo for purely functional components
* Use named exports instead of default exports
* Ensure all calculations and operations remain client-side
* Do not introduce any server communication or data storage
* Organize component files in this order:
  1. Imports
  2. Types/Interfaces
  3. Component
  4. Styles (if using CSS-in-JS)
  5. Exports

### CSS / Styling

* Follow the [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/) if using CSS modules
* Use CSS variables for common values (colors, spacing, etc.)
* Avoid inline styles
